What is virtualization?
It is basically having multiple virtual computers on a single computer
-> To achieve this on any hardware, Supervisor (a software) installed on top of it and then we can
multiple VMs (virtual machines) and each VM can have their own Operating system and the desired app/service
can run independently

Host OS:
It is the operating system of the physical machine

Guest OS:
It is the operating system of the virtual machine

VM:
It is a short form of virtual machine

Snapshot:
It is a way of back up of taking every virtual machine

Hypervisor:
It is a tool or software that enables virtualization

Types of Hypervisor:
Type 1: Bare Metal 
        It can be installed on a physical computer
        On top of hypervisor, we can have either single or multiple VM
        All the VMs can be clustered together, if any one VM down, another VM can take the 
        request and serve the purpose
        It can be used only for Production

Type 2: It is for learning purpose
        We can install this Hypervisor on a physical machine along with other apps can run in the machine
        On top of hypervisor, we can have either single or multiple VM

Practical ways to create VMs (basically Type 2)
 -> first, Creating VM via manual process
    configured two VM manually in oracle virtual box
    one is centosvm
    another one is ubuntuvm (server)
 
 -> second, Creating VM via automatic process
